# ML In Docker Container

Dockerfile and ML Python Program to Train and Save the Machine Learning Model in a Docker Container and then Predict using that container  

## Note
- Here machine learning code is for salary prediction, If you are searching for any other use-case, put up your own machine learning code for model training and prediction

## Prerequisite
- Docker should be Installed

## How to Start
- Clone this repository and go to base directory of the repository
- Now to build the container image, use **'docker build -t img_name:ver .'** command
- After that prediction can be done just by running the container
- To predict we can use both of these ways -
    - **docker run -it img_name:ver** -> It will ask for value on run time
    - **docker run img_name:ver \<val1> \<val2> ..... \<valn>** -> It will directly do the prediction for provided values
